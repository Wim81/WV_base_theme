# WV_base_theme

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of my personal front-end base theme.
This theme uses the following technologies/frameworks/libraries:

- **Sass** for CSS preprocessing
- **Bootstrap** as a front-end framework and the basis upon which I built my personal styles
- **FontAwesome** for all things icons
- **Gulp** for automation
- **jQuery** because I still like it, even in this day and age, for writing simpler Javascript

This theme contains a kitchen sink page, which shows all default components.
The idea is to take this as a easy starting point upon which to build a new, custom theme.

This base theme has a lot of default values which show how the components are built.
These default values should be overwritten. When you dou, please remove the *//default* comment for obvious reasons

In general, a BEM methodology has been used in the Sass setup.
I tend not to overdo this though, and have maintained my personal preference as to the extent of BEM usage overall.
You'll see what I mean when diving into the code.
